                        <p>You are betting on the result of a 100 sided dice roll. The
                            result of the dice roll is bounded to 1-100. To win, the dice result needs to be lower
                            than your number. If the dice result is lower than your number you win!</p>
                        <ol class="bold">
                            <li>Set the bet amount (units of Ether).</li>
                            <li>Adjust the slider to change your number and percentage chance of winning.</li>
                            <li>To win, the dice result needs to be lower than your number.</li>
                            <li>Click 'ROLL!'</li>
                            <li>If the result of the dice roll is lower than your 'Roll under'' number (as shown in the
                                middle colum), you win immediately!
                            </li>
                            <li>If you lose, the contract will send you back 1 Wei</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Note: In the case of a win a 1% commission is subtracted from the total amount returned to
                            the
                            player. You will incur a small gas charge to place the bet. Etheroll does not receive gas.
                            Gas
                            is used to maintain the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

                        <p>To connect to Etheroll and place bets, you will first need to sync Geth to the latest block. Once

                        <p>If you would prefer just to watch some games without unlocking your account, start Geth with the

                        <p>Etheroll enables individuals to place bets and choose their own odds, on the result of a 100-sided dice roll, without sign-ups or user deposits, using Ether – the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency in the world. </p>

                        <p>Etheroll is an Ethereum smart-contract and Dapp which provides a provably-fair dice game leveraging the distributed power of transparent smart-contracts to decentralize its codebase whilst exposing an intuitive web-based interface to players.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">How does it work?</h4>

                        <p>Etheroll is based on an Ethereum smart contract. It is executed by the Ethereum network, which
                            enables it to operate in a partially decentralized fashion to provide a transparent, provably
                            fair
                            gambling service.</p>

                        <p>Our random number is the only external dependency for our smart-contract as the nature of blockchains make it unsafe for us (not you) to calculate
                            random data inside the blockchain in a secure way.</p>

                        <p>Once our Ethereum smart contract receives a random number from random.org, the results are
                            calculated against the number you submitted
                            and winning bets are paid out instantly.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">What is the house edge?</h4>

                        <p>Our house-edge is a low 1%.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">Why can't I place a bet?</h4>

                        <p>To place a bet first you will need to install Mist browser and sync to the best block on the Ethereum network. For details on how to install Mist browser, please visit our 'How to Play' tab.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">Is it provably-fair?</h4>

                        <p>Etheroll is 100% provably-fair. We don't use the number returned from random org as our final number (which means in the remote edge-case chance there is ever a rogue employee at random org, they will not be able to exploit our game, as they do not control our final number), on top of this, we keep our oracle honest by recording the serial numbers returned from our random org responses (which increment by 1 for each response). This means our oracle cannot cheat us or our players without it being detected by submitting multiple requests to random org and only submitting suitable results along with their corresponding TLSNotary proof (TLSNotary proof alone is not enough, because the oracle could simply make multiple requests). Our system is 100% provably-fair. Anybody can view the serial number responses by watching event filters in Ethereum Wallet/Mist, coupled with the corresponding TLSNotary proofs. Of course, you can always browse the source code of our smart-contract under the 'Smart Contract' tab as well as check the verification link to ensure our code does exactly what we say it does. Our game is 100% provably-fair and it is something we are very proud of.</p>

                        <p>Our ÐICE token allows you to bet on the house with the house advantage in your favor. When you purchase ÐICE tokens you own a portion of the bankroll, proportional to the amount of ÐICE tokens you hold. There will only ever be a fixed total supply of 7,001,622.64 ÐICE tokens. ÐICE tokens are available on <a href="https://etherdelta.github.io/#DICE-ETH">EtherDelta</a> exchange. Once you are a ÐICE token holder, every 12 weeks you will be granted special rights and priviledges within the platform that enable you to draw down the profits your ÐICE tokens generated by playing every game with the house edge working to their advantage. For more details on ÐICE and the platform in general, you can browse our <a href="http://crowdfund.etheroll.com/etheroll-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> (PDF).</p>

                        <h4 class="green">How do I claim my ÐICE token rewards?</h4>

                        <p>We are currently in the process of writing our rewards smart-contract. Once it has passed internal testing and independant security audits, rewards will be available to token holders from our website every 12 weeks for a period of 5 days. As a ÐICE token holder the process to claim the ether you earned will be as simple as one click of a button on our website and confirming your password using Mist browser.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">How will I know it is time to collect my ÐICE rewards?</h4>

                        <p>A new section will be added soon to our website that will display a countdown to the reward periods. You can also follow our <a href="https://etheroll.wordpress.com">blog</a> to receive email updates from us.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">What happens to my ÐICE rewards if I don't claim them?</h4>

                        <p>It is important that you claim your rewards during each reward period. If you do not claim your allocated rewards during the rewards period, your rewards are sent back into the community bankroll and distributed pro-rata during the next rewards phase.</p>

                        <h4 class="green">I placed a bet but received no result using Metamask. Why?</h4>

                        <p>We do not currently fully support Metamask. We currently fully support Mist browser and recommend using it if you experience this problem with Google Chrome + Metamask. It is likely that you did receive a result from us but Metamask did not notify you of the result. Check your wallet address (<span

                            IPFS. The IPFS multihash returned for each bet is processed as an event by Etheroll into the
